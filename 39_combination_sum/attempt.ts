/*

Since I need all unique combinations of candidates where chosen cadndidates sum to target, I can use backtracking

I could start with 0 as the root condition


                                    0
                            add2      don't
                            2           0
                        add2   don't      add2    don't
                    4           2            2         0
                add2    don't add2 don't add2 don't add2 don't
            6          4     4       2     4    2    2       0
