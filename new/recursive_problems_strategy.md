## Understand the Problem:

Read and understand the problem statement thoroughly. Identify the inputs, outputs, and any specific constraints. Try to come up with an example to illustrate the problem.


## Identify Base Case(s):

In recursive problems, the base case(s) are the stopping conditions for the recursion. They are the simplest scenarios where the function can return a result directly without making further recursive calls.

## Define the Recursive Function:

Create a function that will solve the problem using recursion. This function should take input parameters and return the desired output.

## Think Inductively:

Assume that the recursive function already works correctly for smaller inputs (closer to the base case). Use this assumption to think about how you can combine the smaller solutions to solve the larger problem.

## Trace with Smaller Inputs:

Before diving into the complete recursive code, trace the function manually with smaller inputs. Follow the flow of the recursion, keeping track of the parameters and return values at each step.

## Use Print Statements or Debugging:

Add print statements to the recursive function to see the flow of execution and the values of variables at each step. Alternatively, use a debugger to step through the code.

## Draw Recursion Tree (Optional):

For complex recursive problems, drawing a recursion tree can help visualize the calls and better understand the flow of the recursion. This can be particularly helpful when you have overlapping subproblems.

## Work Towards Base Case:

Make sure your recursive function approaches the base case(s) in each recursive call. If not, you may end up in an infinite loop.

## Combine Recursive Calls:

Once you've ensured that the recursive function reaches the base case, focus on combining the results of recursive calls to achieve the final solution. Understand how the function uses the smaller solutions to solve the entire problem.

## Test Thoroughly:

After implementing the recursive function, test it with different inputs, including edge cases and boundary conditions. Verify that it produces the correct results.

## Optimize (If Possible):

Sometimes, recursive solutions may have overlapping subproblems, leading to redundant calculations. In such cases, consider memoization (caching results) or dynamic programming to optimize the solution.
